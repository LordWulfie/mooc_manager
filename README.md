# mooc_manager

I created this program as a project for my CS course. It is a simple tracking site for MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses).

Features:
1. User login 
2. Basic User Profile 
3. MOOC tracking (location, resources, date)
4. Daily Journal 

It is a small and simple program utilizing Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, HTML, and Bootstrap.
